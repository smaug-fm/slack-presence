# slack-presence

Makes you appear _active_ on Slack, even when you are notðŸ˜‰

Runs in a Docker container, so you can self-host it or host in the cloud.</br>
Uses [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) notifications to alert you when you start & stop appearing
online.

### Getting started

You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system.
For the initial setup follow these steps:

1. Get the
   default [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smaug-fm/slack-presence/master/docker-compose.yml)
   and place it somewhere on your machine. In that folder slack-presence will create `chrome` folder
   with internal Chrome user data
   and `options.json` with slack-presence settings.

2. Change `TZ=Europe/Kiev` in the `docke-compose.yml` file to your
   local [timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
3. Run the following command in the workfolder where you placed `docker-compose.yml`
   ```bash
   docker-compopse up -d
   ```
4. Visit [http://localhost:9333](http://localhost:9333) and:
    - Enter your Slack workspace URL.
    - Optionally change online appearance schedule, or leave the default 9am to 6pm.
    - Enable Slack-presence
5. For the first time you will have to manually login to your Slack workspace within internal
   browser. Wait for the message to appear and then follow instructions.
6. You are good to go! You now appear as Active on Slack from Monday till Friday by your selected
   schedule.
7. Optional. Setup [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) notifications.

From time to time your Slack login session will expire and you will have to re-login manually.

### Pushover notifications

Slack-presence can notify you via [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) when you start/stop appearing
online, when your Slack login session has expired or when something went wrong.
I personally also use this feature as a reminder to start/end my workdayðŸ™‚.
<br/>
<br/>
To setup Pushover you have to create an account there and obtain two keys:

- Your User Key (example: `zLkWytJOeiuBFambEOTHCuTYJCbwTJ`)
- Your API Token/Key (example: `bfRUJGNjsFxJSlYkDlMYdSFXuewHjT`)

Update your `docker-compose.json` with your keys (I used example keys here):

```bash
- PUSHOVER_USER_KEY=zLkWytJOeiuBFambEOTHCuTYJCbwTJ
- PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN=bfRUJGNjsFxJSlYkDlMYdSFXuewHjT
```

Then restart slack-presence:

```bash
docker-compose restart
```

### How does it work

There are several approaches to make Slack believe that you are active:

1. Actually being active (too hard, boring)
2. Always open Slack on a smartphone with sleep turned off (requires a separate smartphone)
3. Mouse jiggler with a desktop app (unreliable, requires a dedicated PC with a GUI)
4. Slack API (no longer works)
5. Third-party (usually paid and proprietary) services, like [this](https://presencescheduler.com/)
   one.
6. Selenium (or simiar) tool to drive a Slack web browser tab.

This tool uses approach #6 as the most reliable and consistent one. It's basically like #1, but
automated.
It uses [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to start and drive a headless (with no graphical UI but
full-featured)
Chrome instance which logs in to Slack web app at your provided workspace URL and then periodically
refreshes the page to
make you appear active.
As slack uses two-factor authentication and captcha you have to login to Slack web manually for the
first time (and then from time to time when login session expires)
but fortunately [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/)
allows you to remotely
connect to a headless Chrome and do all the work in a nice way.
